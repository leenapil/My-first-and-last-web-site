  <h2>JavaScript이란?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/The_web_standards_model_-_HTML_CSS_and_JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> is the scripting language that you use to add behaviour to your web pages — it can be used to validate the data you enter into a form (tell you if it is in the right format or not), provide drag and drop functionality, change styles on the fly, animate page elements such as menus, handle button functionality, and a million other things.
    Most modern JavaScript works by finding a target HTML element, and then doing something to it, just like CSS, but the way it operates, the syntax etc. is rather different.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:10px;">JavaScript is a more complicated and expansive subject than HTML and CSS, so to keep things simple and avoid confusion at this stage, I won’t be discussing it in the below example. In fact, you won’t be looking at JavaScript in this course again until Programming - the real basics</p></body>
